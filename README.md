* Win32 Users

The Win32 support is *NOT* complete!  If you'd like to work
it, be my guest.  At this moment, only linux is supported.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The templates in this package are for me and my purposes.
If you would like to modify them, I reccomend that
you do so before running the install.sh script.  This
will limit confusion on your part.

If you have any more suggestions for utilities,
feel free to send me an email at themanchicken@gmail.com.
